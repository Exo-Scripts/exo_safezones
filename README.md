## What is it?

This is a basic resource that allows you to set multiple safe zones for desired areas. When a player enters a safezone they will restricted from to shooting, fighting or punching. The player will also be notified that they are in a safezone. 

## Configuration

The following can be found in the ``config.lua`` file.
```
    Config = {
    Alert = "~g~You are in a safezone.",
    Warning = "~r~You are in a ~g~safezone. ~r~You can not shoot.",
    Radius = 50,
    Locations = {
        -- Set the locations you wish to be a safezone.
        -- Format: {XCoord, YCoord, ZCoord, Radius}
        -- example {1850.04, 3687.3, 32.47},
    }
    }
```
